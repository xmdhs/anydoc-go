// Shared, copy-on-write linear memory.
//
// Most of what an instance of a large wasm module costs is memory that is
// IDENTICAL in every instance and, apart from a handful of pages, never written
// to. A big engine can carry tens of MB of static tables in its data segments,
// and build more heap still while it starts its runtime up. Every instance
// paying for its own copy of all that is pure waste.
//
// So build it ONCE per process and give every instance a private copy-on-write
// map of it: read-only pages stay physically shared, and only a page a guest
// actually writes becomes private.
//
// There are two kinds of image, and they differ in how much of the built
// instance they keep:
//
//   - NewSharedImage keeps the data segments. Instances (NewWithMemory) re-run
//     their own initialization over them, so the image must carry NOTHING above
//     the segments: that tail is BSS, and it holds the start section's
//     "already ran" flag and the C++ static state. Inheriting the flag makes
//     the start section trap on its second run; inheriting statics that point
//     into a heap the image does not carry breaks the first thing that follows
//     one of those pointers. What makes even the segments survive the re-run is
//     that memory.init compares before it writes (see memoryInit) — it finds
//     them already in place and leaves the pages shared.
//
//   - NewSharedSnapshot keeps the whole initialized instance, memory and wasm
//     globals both. Instances (NewFromSnapshot) re-run NOTHING, which is what
//     lets the snapshot keep the BSS and the heap that the first kind has to
//     throw away. It shares much more; it also freezes whatever the build did.
//
// Measured on one large embedding (instances live in a 4 GiB container, created
// until the kernel kills the process): a hundred-odd without any image, several
// times that with the data-segment image, and an order of magnitude more with
// the snapshot, which shares the started runtime's heap on top of the segments.
//
// Where mmap is unavailable (windows, js/wasm — see sharedimage_nommap.go),
// every instance allocates and initializes its own memory, exactly as before.

// NewSharedSnapshot builds an image of a FULLY INITIALIZED instance — memory
// and wasm globals, everything, exactly as build() left it — and caches it the
// same way. Instances go through NewFromSnapshot, which re-runs nothing at all.
//
// This shares far more than NewSharedImage does. A runtime's initialization
// (C++ static constructors, an interpreter's own start-up) leaves megabytes of
// heap behind that are identical in every instance, and NewSharedImage cannot
// share ANY of it: it must zero the BSS, because a fresh instance re-runs the
// initialization and would trip over the previous one's leftovers. A snapshot
// re-runs nothing, so it can keep the lot.
//
// The catch is that build() must leave the instance in a state every later
// instance can start from. Anything build() does is done for all of them — an
// instance that is already holding a lock or mid-request is not a snapshot, it
// is a bug. Build it clean and take it at rest.
//
// Unlike NewSharedImage, this does NOT cache: a snapshot bakes in whatever
// build() configured, so whether two callers want the same snapshot is a
// question only the caller can answer. Build it once and hold on to it (a
// caller whose instances come in flavours will want one per flavour); building
// it per instance would be slower than not sharing at all.
